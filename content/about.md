{{< profile username="dougdomingos" >}}

Undergraduate student in **Computer Science** at the **Federal University of Campina Grande
(UFCG)**.

**I don't have a strong preference** for any particular field within Computer Science. **I simply
enjoy solving problems**, regardless of the area or technologies involved. I prefer to **learn new
tools & techniques through hands-on experience**, and I like to understand how things work down to
the smallest details.

What began as a simple desire to create fun games has evolved into both my **profession and a
personal pursuit**. Whether inside the office or during my free time, programming provides me with a
**deep sense of fulfillment**.

Beyond the endless lines of code, I also have an interest in **Pixel Art** (despite being _really_
bad at it, as of now), **indie games**, and of course, **coffee**.
