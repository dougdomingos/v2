My name is Douglas Silva. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at Federal University of
Campina Grande (UFCG), and currently working as IT Support and DevOps at Guardians UFCG.

At first, my interest in programming was simply to learn how to make games. I began studying
Python through YouTube free courses. Since then, I've explored a ton of different
technologies and fields of software development. Although I'm not sure of which career path
to choose yet, I want to make our lifes easier and more fun through software.
