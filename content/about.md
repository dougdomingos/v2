My name is Douglas Silva. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at Federal University of
Campina Grande (UFCG), and currently working as IT Support and DevOps at Guardians UFCG.

I began my adventures in the world of programming in 2019, learning Python using only
my phone and watching free online courses from the YouTube channel
"[Curso em VÃ­deo](https://youtube.com/c/CursoEmVideo)" by professor Gustavo Guanabara.
My inital goal was to learn how to make games, but there are so many possibilities
in this vast world that I simply like to code, no matter the purpose.

Currently, this are the techonologies I have experience with (or have interest of
learning at some point):

- Frontend development with `React` and `NextJS`
- Backend development with `Java` and `Spring Boot`
- System Administration with Linux
- Game development
- Research and development
- Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking
